# Introduction

Welcome to **LibDocsPoC** – a demo .NET class library designed to showcase API documentation and usage examples using DocFX.

This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for generating developer-friendly documentation. It features:

- Simple, well-documented C# components
- Autogenerated API references
- Usage guides for real-world scenarios
- Static site generation via DocFX and GitHub Pages

## Project Structure

The project is organized into logical namespaces:

- `LibDocsPoC.Geometry` – Shapes like Circle and Rectangle
- `LibDocsPoC.Math` – Basic math utilities
- `LibDocsPoC.Utilities` – Helper methods for strings and more

## Goal

This documentation demonstrates how to:

- Automatically generate API reference docs from XML comments
- Write custom usage guides for each component
